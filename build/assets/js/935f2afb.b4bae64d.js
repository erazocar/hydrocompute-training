This means that lots of the work required to run a computation is done sequentially, one instruction at a time. This is a compromise that can be made when running simple web applications. However, a complete application usually runs thousands of instructions, and having computationally expensive work can freeze a UI. Not good.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial/Scheduler":{"id":"tutorial/Scheduler","title":"Scheduler","description":"The HydroCompute library was developed with the goal of supporting simulations that require executing N steps with M functions within each step. It provides flexibility in how data is passed to functions within each step, allowing for the use of the same data, different data, or results from previous functions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
