# Statistical forecasting

Using the HydroLang library coupled with the HydroCompute library, let's create a simple dashboard that retrieves streamflow information from different sources around 

## Objectives

This case study aims to show the capability to create powerful pipelines that can run in paralell or sequentially to analyze real time data sources using the HydroCompute library.

## Data Preparation

## Setting up the Pipeline

## Running the Simulation

## Visualizing Results
