# Engine Layer

The HydroCompute library contains 3 engines for computing and 1 for data transfer. Let's explore each to see how they can be used, and how users can port their own code.

To run a specific set of functions in different code fomats, the user can:
- Place their code following the guidelines for each engine
- Place the code in the rooth directory hat is instantiating the compute library

Additionally, the users can call the `engineScripts()` method within the instance object to retrieve the functions and scripts available for use.

:::tip Tip
HydroCompute's engine guidelines can be found within each of the engines.

## JavaScript Engine

The main interface used as entry point for the compute is JavaScript. The code implemented as an interface for the HydroCompute are objects that have the following structure:

```js
const myCollectionOfFunctions = {
    function1: (data) =>{...},
    function2: (data) => {...},
    main: () => {...}
}
```

The user either select a function from a specific object of functions, or use the `main` function to run.

### Example 1

In the following code snippet there is a file named `jsExample.js` which we will call to run using the the following:

```js
const compute= new hydrocompute();
compute.data({data: [1,2,3,4,5]});
compute.run('jsExample')
```

Let's do a more hands on example. There are several functions available for usage within the compute engine. 

## Web Assembly Engine

The Web Assembly engine contains `.wasm` files and glue code generated by different type of compiled languages. The HydroCompute uses the gluecode generated from different types fo compilers to call the compiled modules upon request. Ehen requiring 

:::note Note
As first deployment instances, the HydroCompute engine can handle C-Emscripten and AssemblyScript-compiled wasm files. New ones will be added in the future.

### Example 2

Run the command

```js
const compute = new hydrocompute();
compute.date({'dat_example'})
```

## WebGPU Engine

Similar to the JavaScript files, the WebGPU code is used within the library as a JS object that can be given with the following structure:

```js
const myCollectionOfFunctions = {
    function1: (data) =>{...//WGSL Code as string},
    function2: (data) => {...//WGSL Code as string},
    main: () => {...}
}
```

The WebGPU engine deals with the

::note Note
The WebGPU Engine is mostly tailored towards parallelizable workloads that are often seen when dealing with N-D data. The available scripts within the HydroCompute engine currently support matritial computations, however will be expanded in the future.
