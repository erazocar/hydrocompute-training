# About this lesson

This lesson space serves as an introduction to the use of **HydroCompute**, a client-side computational library for hydrology and environmental sciences.

## Objectives

- Familiarize yourself with the object-oriented architecture developed with HydroCompute.
- Explore different engines and their corresponding functions for hydrological sciences.
- Create end-to-end projects and workflows that run using minimal code.


## Skills You'll Gain

- Understand the use of multithreading technology available in web browsers.
- Get acquainted with new technologies such as WebRTC, WebGPU, and WebAssembly.
- Create complete workflows for hydrological sciences.
- Learn how to use HydroCompute to run a simulation through sequential and parallel code execution.


## Syllabus

- **[Introduction](../docs/intro.mdx)**: Learn about HydroCompute architecture, and open-source nature.
- **[Multithreading](../docs/tutorial/multithread)**: Learn about running parallel and sequential tasks through the use of web worker technologies.
- **[Engines](../docs/tutorial/engines)**: Learn how to run code from different sources and programming languages and port them into a common ground for web usage..
- **[Case Studies](../docs/tutorial/_category_.json)**: Learn about the development of a case study evaluating speed and using different libraries for development.

:::caution Caution
Some of the technologies that will be covered in this presentation are still **experimental** and not fully supported in all web browsers. Please take this in consideration when using the library.
